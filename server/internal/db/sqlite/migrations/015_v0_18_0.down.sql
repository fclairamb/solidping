-- Teardown/parity half of the consolidated v0.18.0 migration — never run in
-- production. Sections appear in the EXACT REVERSE order of 015_v0_18_0.up.sql,
-- so each one unwinds on a schema that still has everything the sections above
-- it created.
--
-- Several sections are lossy on the way down; each says so in its own note.

-- ==========================================================================
-- SECTION: generic-attachments
-- Was scratch migration 020_generic_attachments (spec 2026-08-21-01). Teardown half.
-- ==========================================================================

-- Teardown/parity only — never run in production. SQLite mirror of the
-- generic-attachments section of postgres/migrations/015_v0_18_0.down.sql.
--
-- LOSSY the same way the Postgres half is: dropping the columns destroys every
-- attachment link while leaving the blobs and their `files` rows behind.
